          "description": "whole chickens are so easy to make and really look impressive on the dinner table. this recipe creates a well-seasoned and juicy chicken with a wonderfully flavorful stuffing. i have made this recipe a number of times over the years and have always had outstanding results and raves. i found the recipe in 365 ways to cook chicken. sometimes i add cooking wine to the water that the rice cooks in…. otherwise i really don’t need to change a thing.\r\n\r\n--note--\r\nthis chicken makes an outstanding chicken salad for sandwiches the next day. simply mix the left over chicken and stuffing with mayonnaise. it is hard to get the chicken salad onto the bread without eating it all before hand!",
